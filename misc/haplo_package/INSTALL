diri_sampler, contain and freqEst
-----------------
Running make should be sufficient in many cases. In case
the gsl library is not located in the standard location,
you may have to edit the lines indicated in Makefile.

dec.py
-----------------
Install EMBOSS and place a link to the needle executable file in the
working directory
e.g.
[user@host]$ ln -sv emboss_installation/EMBOSS-5.0.0/emboss/needle needle
emboss_installation/EMBOSS-5.0.0/emboss/needle -> needle

Optionally, place a link to the reference genome (in FASTA format) and call
it ref_genome.fas (this can also be controlled by command line options,
see README)
e.g.
[user@host]$ ln -sv my_database/my_reference.fas ref_genome.fas
my_database/my_reference.fas ref_genome.fas
