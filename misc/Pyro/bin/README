DECONTAMINATE.PY
filtered reads are aligned to the consensus sequence and the recognized contaminants and
divide in files closer_to_ref, closer_to_cont1


FILTER_BY_QUAL.PY
All 16 read files were filtered according to their quality scores(fna and qual files are in the 
data directory): reads in which the minimum phred score is lower than 15 were excluded.


DEC_START.PY
USed also to specify the window range.


PLOT_COV.PY
Simple plot of the coverage from the .far file.


READS_ANALIZE.PY
After the diri_sampler run, the corrected reads were analyzed with the program reads_analyze.py. 
It takes corrected reads and original reads as input parameter.
It considers all reads with a quality exceeding a given threshold (default: 0.999), that do not 
contain gaps1 and have less than 5 N's. Haplotypes differing at most because of missing data are 
considered together. A plot is produced of frequencies, showing at the same time the equivalent 
frequency of 510, 20, 50 reads. 
The last step is to check the support these haplotypes find in the original reads.

ALIGN_ALL.PY
Uses Novoalign to align read to 10 different haplotypes.
