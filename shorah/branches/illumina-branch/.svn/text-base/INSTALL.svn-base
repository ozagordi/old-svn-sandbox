diri_sampler, contain and freqEst
-----------------
Running make should be sufficient in many cases. In case
the gsl library is not located in the standard location,
you may have to edit the lines indicated in Makefile.

step2far.py
-----------------
Install EMBOSS and place a link to the needle executable file in the
working directory
e.g.
[user@host]$ ln -sv emboss_installation/EMBOSS-5.0.0/emboss/needle
emboss_installation/EMBOSS-5.0.0/emboss/needle -> needle

In alternative, edit the needle_exe variable in the code (step2far.py,
after the import statements)
